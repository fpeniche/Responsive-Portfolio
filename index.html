                            Hello everybody, this is Fernando Peniche struggling to get going with his first "alive" webpage. This is my first work, so I hope you guys forgive some of the flaws it may present, but as I get better in the art of coding, because believe me, it is an art; I promise you I will improve and give it better visuals and enhance it with all posible features I can get my hands to. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let me tell you something about me. I was born in Mexico City, yeah, that big city with lots of issues, but, at the same time, lots of cool things to do and enjoy, and great, friendly people. My mother still lives there. I have one sister and she lives in Dubai with her husband and two beautiful kids, my twin nephews: Sofia and Miguel. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 40px"> 
                            I like all kind of sports, but soccer, tennis, football and car racing are my favorites. I do information systems consulting for living, especially SAP and its satellite technologies. This front-end coding craziness was a natural next step for me.
                        </p>
